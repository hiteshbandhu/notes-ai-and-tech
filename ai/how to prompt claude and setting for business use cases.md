### prompting vs fine-tuning

Prompt engineering is far faster than other methods of model behavior control, such as finetuning, and can often yield leaps in performance in far less time. Here are some reasons to consider prompt engineering over finetuning:  

- **Resource efficiency**: Fine-tuning requires high-end GPUs and large memory, while prompt engineering only needs text input, making it much more resource-friendly.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper.
- **Maintaining model updates**: When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes.
- **Time-saving**: Fine-tuning can take hours or even days. In contrast, prompt engineering provides nearly instantaneous results, allowing for quick problem-solving.
- **Minimal data needs**: Fine-tuning needs substantial task-specific, labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive. Prompt engineering works with few-shot or even zero-shot learning.
- **Flexibility & rapid iteration**: Quickly try various approaches, tweak prompts, and see immediate results. This rapid experimentation is difficult with fine-tuning.
- **Domain adaptation**: Easily adapt models to new domains by providing domain-specific context in prompts, without retraining.
- **Comprehension improvements**: Prompt engineering is far more effective than finetuning at helping models better understand and utilize external content such as retrieved documents
- **Preserves general knowledge**: Fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses general knowledge. Prompt engineering maintains the model’s broad capabilities.
- **Transparency**: Prompts are human-readable, showing exactly what information the model receives. This transparency aids in understanding and debugging.

## prompting techniques for models


1. Be clear, and show it to colleague with minimal context of the problem. if the new colleague is confused in reading the prompt and following the instructions, the model will be too
#### How to be clear, contextual, and specific

- **Give Claude contextual information:** Just like you might be able to better perform on a task if you knew more context, Claude will perform better if it has more contextual information. Some examples of contextual information:
    - What the task results will be used for
    - What audience the output is meant for
    - What workflow the task is a part of, and where this task belongs in that workflow
    - The end goal of the task, or what a successful task completion looks like
- **Be specific about what you want Claude to do:** For example, if you want Claude to output only code and nothing else, say so.

> **Provide instructions as sequential steps:** Use numbered lists or bullet points to better ensure that Claude carries out the task the exact way you want it to.


#### GOOD VS BAD PROMPTS
