This represents a sparse-and-rough roadmap i drew for myself sitting in my hostel room. But, this can be applied to anyone, just don't do the following :

- choosing both node.js and python as backend frameworks - choose one and master it completely. you have to do react/next for frontend, but for the agentic/retrieval, nothing beats python
- also, have some curiosity, read papers and books, know how things work bts, like vector databases and semantic search, do some maths 


#### Here is the mind-map, no boundation, modify as per your need
