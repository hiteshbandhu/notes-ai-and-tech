**Context:** This note outlines a personal roadmap for building AI applications, emphasizing strategic choices in backend frameworks (Python vs. Node.js), the importance of mastering one, and the necessity of understanding underlying technologies like vector databases and semantic search.


This represents a sparse-and-rough roadmap i drew for myself sitting in my hostel room. But, this can be applied to anyone, just don't do the following :

- choosing both node.js and python as backend frameworks - choose one and master it completely. you have to do react/next for frontend, but for the agentic/retrieval, nothing beats python
- also, have some curiosity, read papers and books, know how things work bts, like vector databases and semantic search, do some maths 


#### Here is the mind-map, no boundation, modify as per your need
