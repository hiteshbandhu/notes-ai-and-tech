## if we want to narrow down our search, we use google search operator


1. `site :` search results will be pulled only from that specific website
2. `intitle` : searches for the string in the title
3. `inurl` : searches for the string in the url
4. `intext` : searches for the string in the body of the webpage
5. `filetype:` searches for the specific file type on the domain
6. `allinurl:` searches for everything after the operator
7. `-{term}` : removes the term from the results
8. `after`: search results after a date
9. `before` : search results before the data
