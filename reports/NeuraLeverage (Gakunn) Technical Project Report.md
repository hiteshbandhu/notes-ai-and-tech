K[Gemini-1.5-flash] -->|Content guardrails| J

```

  

#### Server-side Processing:

1. **Paper Collection**: A cron job runs twice daily (12 AM and 12 PM) to fetch new, trending papers in the generative AI field from arXiv.

2. **Data Processing**:

   - The collected papers are added to the database.

   - Text is extracted and parsed from each paper.

   - Claude-3.5-sonnet generates a summary for each paper, which is stored in the database.

3. **Quiz Generation**: Parallel requests are sent to Claude-3.5-sonnet to generate quizzes based on the paper content. These quizzes are then saved to the quiz database.

4. **Authentication**: Standard authentication routes are implemented using Supabase.

  

#### Frontend Interaction:

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in and receive 10 free credits to try the project.

2. **Content Navigation**: Users select a field of interest (e.g., Computer Vision, Language Models, Transformers).

3. **Paper Selection**: Users browse through available papers and read the AI-generated summaries.
